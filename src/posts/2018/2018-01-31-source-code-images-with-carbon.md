Ever wondered how those pretty little code snippets are generated? Most likely they have been made in [Carbon][2]. This is a nifty little source code screenshot generator, excellent for saving those perfect slices of logic for the world to see. With a number of different settings, from font to syntax highlighting it&#8217;s a great addition to any publication where you need little snippets highlighted beautifully.
