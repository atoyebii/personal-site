# Personal Hugo Website

This is the source code for my personal website [https://jamesrwilliams.co.uk](https://jamesrwilliams.co.uk), and eventually it's `.ca` TLD replacement!
Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using a custom made theme, that I might release sometime in the future as a stand alone project.
