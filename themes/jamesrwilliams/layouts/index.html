I'm currently exploring ways to integrate static site generators (like Hugo and Gatsby) into more projects with the wonderful team at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://points.com">Points</a>. In my spare time I'm building native apps with things like Ionic Framework and Angular.</p>
			<p>On this site you can find some <a href="/blog/">posts</a> about various things I've been working on. You can find more examples of my work on my <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/jamesrwilliams">GitHub</a> profile.
