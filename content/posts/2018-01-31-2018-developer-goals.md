<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Here is a quick rundown of what I want to achieve in terms of technology and professional development this year: </span>
</p>

  * Release my Ionic/Firebase app
  * Produce a demo of [LUIS][1] and/or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/" rel="nofollow">Google CLP</a>
  * Learn (some) <a href="https://reactjs.org/" rel="nofollow">React.js</a> and subsequently use <a href="https://wordpress.github.io/gutenberg/" rel="nofollow">WordPress Gutenberg</a>
  * Demo Chatbot work with MSFT bot builder explore DialogFlow

Some of these are moonshots and some are just things I want to do at somepoint.
