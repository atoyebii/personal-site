I have taken a move to rebuild my personal site in Hugo instead of WordPress! Why you ask? Why the heck not. I spend most of my professional life building WordPress sites for clients, why stop now. For me I think it was the danger of familiarity. When I started building this theme I knew very little about Hugo and how it works. My only other experience of static site generators was a little dabble of Jekyll when exploring GitHub pages.
