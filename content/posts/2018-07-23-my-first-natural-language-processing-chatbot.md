Back during December of 2017, I started working on a new project at Silver, fully departed from anything I had done before. A node.js based Chatbot, the application that was going to be integrated into a new Microsoft Office applications: Microsoft Teams as part of an internal campaign for Microsoft&#8217;s UK marketing team.

  * Node.js on Heroku,
  * [Microsoft Bot framework][1],
  * AWS RDS,
  * [LUIS Natural Language Processing][2],
  * Delivering the bot (packaging into a Microsoft Teams application) using Microsoft&#8217;s BotBuilder framework,
  * Monitoring and review (google analytics goals and events),

## Planning and Goals {#planning-and-goals}

## Implementation {#implementation}

## Iterations {#iterations}

## Review {#review}

One thing we did struggle with was managing expectations around the natural language element of the chatbot. Understanding the sheer complexities of human writing/speech. For example how many different ways and words can you use to ask a chatbot to book you a place at an event?

## Delivery {#delivery}

  * Configure the NLP model for production on LUIS
  * Upload application zip

## Retrospective {#retrospective}

I enjoyed this project immensely. It was a far different project from previous projects at Silver and I realised it. Learning so much about NodeJs, servers, language processing and such like made it better. I can now recognise what I did wrong, and what I should have done. For example, there are zero tests
