## Hugo CLI

This is my go to demo server command for the Hugo CLI with two main arguments.

```bash
hugo server -D --disableFastRender
```

The `-D` here renders draft posts so I can see how my drafts are doing (the short hand makes it easy to remove if required).r

## Documentation

Very useful documentation links for when you're building your own theme:

- [Hugo templates documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/)
