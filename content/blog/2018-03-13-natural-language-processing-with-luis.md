As part of a recent project with <a href="https://silver.agnecy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silver</a> I have had some time to experiment with Natural Language processing. The project entered around a chatbot integration that allowed users to interact with our campaign.

We quickly noticed that there was a multitude of ways people can ask to be &#8220;registered&#8221; onto an event or event just ask basic event details.
