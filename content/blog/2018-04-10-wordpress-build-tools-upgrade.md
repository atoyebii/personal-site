To try and be more mobile and to support more remote testing/building tools we are aiming to move away from codeKit to more command line based tools. At silver we use codekit religiously.

Holy grail I think I&#8217;m looking for: **Deploy WordPress theme via buddy using gulp to build.**

  * LiveReload
  * Image optimisation
  * Lint (SCSS/JS) https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint
  * File inclusion / imports
  * Mapping (SCSS & JS)
  *
