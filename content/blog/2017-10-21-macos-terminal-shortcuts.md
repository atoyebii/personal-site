My iMac at home is configured with two harddirves, one SSD with the OS and some core applications the other, much larger 2TB drive has all my files, music and alike on it.

This 2TB drive also houses my projects directory. A dumping ground for anything remotely related to a project or code I have on VCS.Â  With the way OS X handles volumes (and the fact I stupidly named this directory with a space in its name, traversing into it is a pain.

So behold the terminal shortcuts!

    subl wp-config.php

    <?php get_header(); ?>
    
    	<div class="container">
    		<div class="row">
    			<div class="col-xs-12">
    				
    				<?php the_post(); ?>
    				<?php the_content(); ?>
    
    			</div>
    		</div>
    	</div>
    
    <?php get_footer(); ?>
