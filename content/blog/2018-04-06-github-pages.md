I&#8217;ve recently been looking into updating my Github pages to make them into more of a timeless portfolio. Using the GitHub API I can pull a list of my pinned repositories to this site showcasing my most recent side project / public work.

I&#8217;ve gotten this far and hit a roadblock:

_I want to poll and endpoint periodically, say every 24 hours. Cache endpoint response until cache cleared manually or the 24 hour. I&#8217;d need to store this data for that period then whenever the timer or cron updated._
