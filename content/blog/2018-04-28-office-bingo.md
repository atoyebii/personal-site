During a particularly buzzword saturated meeting I had an idea. We all know the game, bingo. Random numbers, whoever stamps them all or another winning pattern wins, right? So put them together and you have buzzword bingo.

Enter the next project I have spend many an evening working on, Office Bingo.

**Features**

  * Multiplayer games
  * Editable word lists
  * Editable victory conditions

Users setup a game and then invite other players using a simple five digit access code. then each player is given a play card with words randomly selected from the hosts chosen list. These lists can organised and edited, so you can create a special marketing department list for &#8220;those&#8221; meetings.

Now there is nothing stopping this app being used outside of the office environment but for now this is the name I&#8217;m sticking with.
