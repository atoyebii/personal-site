It&#8217;s been a busy few months at my current job with [Silver Agency][1]. We&#8217;ve brought onboard a new senior developer who has started injecting knowledge and experience into our processes and stack.

## Agile

Back when I joined silver in October of 2016 I introduced JIRA to move digital projects out of Excell and google sheet documents into a ticket based logging system. At the time I wasn&#8217;t familiar with many agile concepts and saw JIRA as simply a work logging tool, keeping track of tasks and organising them by their status etc. But oh is it so much more.

## Docker

We&#8217;ve introduced Docker. Creating containers per project and per feature branch.

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)

To power our new docker based infrastructure we&#8217;ve opted to use a combination of AWS services. Things like ECR, CloudFront, S3, and EFS. Migrating our once static server-based hosting into something more dynamic and fault tolerant.
