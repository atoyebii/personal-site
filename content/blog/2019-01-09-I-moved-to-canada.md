A little under three months ago, after a year or so of forms and online applications I left the UK, and landed in Canada as a new permanent resident! A move I had been thinking about since early 2016, but towards teh end of 2017 I started the process properly. This has been one of the best decisions I've made in my life. 

The fully online process was completed with. Just a little stress and a last minute passport application later I received the green light. 

As such I've taken this opportunity to redevelop my personal website in Hugo the Go powered static site generator. This site is now deployed via Netlify and it's source is available on GitHub. It's also been moved to a shiny new .ca domain for extra Canadian flare. You can read more about the redevelopment in my post "[Migrating from WordPress to hugo"](/blog/moving-my-website-from-wordpress-to-hugo/).

Oh and if only Marks and Spencer food had made it here.
